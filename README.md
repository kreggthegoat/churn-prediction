# Phase 3 Project : Churn Analysis

Author: Kregg Jackson

## Project Overview

For this project I used multiple classifier models to find why customers were churning.


## The Data

The phone companyâ€™s data frame originally consisted of 21 columns with about 3,300 rows. The description of the column names can be found at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset?datasetId=2667&sortBy=voteCount).

## Methods

I built multiple classifier models after cleaning and evaluating the data. The cleaning process consisted of formatting the data so the classifers can read the data, balancing class imbalance on the dependent variable, and dropping redundant columns. Next I built vizs to visually represent and better understand the predictors relationship with the dependendent variable. Then I built five classifier models and selected the most important features from the best performing model.
